This is a simple facility to search the BBC's Responsive News site. The BBC site has no search facility.

Like with any other search system, you can type a word or phrase in to the search field and it will return some relevent results, chronologically ordered.

As a bonus feature you can type a *comma seperated* list of terms and the results will be merged.

You can *save search terms* for subsequent visits by hitting 'save this search'.
